You can iterate up to 6 times per turn.

returned tools this turn:
{% for t in used_tools | default([]) %}- {{ t.name }}
{% endfor %}

returned actions this turn:
{% for a in used_actions | default([]) %}- {{ a.name }}
{% endfor %}

Notes:
{{ notes | default("") }}
if tool calling is unavailable, you must fallback to issuing a Command via eg: <|-ACTIONS-|> Command(NAME): {json payload}. <| -ENDACTIONS-|>


only return <| -NOTES- |> and <| -ENDTURN-|> if you have no action to take this turn. and want to end your turn before using all 6 iterations.
on the sixtjh iteration, you must end your turn with<| -NOTES-|> and <| -ENDTURN-|>
all <| -NOTES-|> must be concise and relevant to future turns. avoid redundancy. all <| -NOTES-|> are retained for future turns and will be provided to you each turn.
reason about your actions before taking them.
What action do you take this turn?
Remember: output <|- ACTIONS-|> Command(NAME): {...} then <| -ENDACTIONS-|>
